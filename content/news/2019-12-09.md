ADLINK Technology joined today the OpenADx working group to work with us along the autonomous driving toolchain.


ADLINK created and published the [Eclipse Cyclone DDS project](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.cyclonedds).


ADLINK is interested to build together with us a cool middleware based on Eclipse Cyclone DDS and Eclipse iceoryx.
