The [openadx.eclipse.org](https://openadx.eclipse.org) website is generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).

Autonomous driving (AD) is an extremely complex challenge with a complex development process,
which is slowed at every turn by incompatibility between widely used development tools. The tools we
already use in and of themselves are very good, but they do not work seamlessly with one another
simply because they were never designed to work with each other.

This is an industry-wide issue. It slows us all down in the race to automated driving. It costs money and
precious resources to reduce the problem to a manageable level. And the thing about it is that the tool
chain itself is not something we can monetize.

All major stakeholders/users have issues associated with tool incompatibility, data conversion and lost
time.
